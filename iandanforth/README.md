# Dreams

## Community

- An opinionated pypi
    - Huge dependency trees and bloated packages should be outright blocked.
    - Packages without passing tests should be blocked
- An opinionated formatting tool like fmt for Go.
    - Don't ask for PEP8, demand it.

## Technical

- No more dunder for common, must-use names
    - Most importantly rename __init__ to construct
- Death to Numpy
    - Nothing, absolutely nothing should be as bloated, hard to use, and system dependent as Numpy is.
    - The top 90% of functions should be re-written, without FORTRAN deps.
- A cross-platform GPU aware drawing layer. 
    - Bring Pygame into the 21st century.
- Death to Python 3
    - It's too much, too late. Unicode just does not matter that much.
- Speed. Always and forever we need greater speed.
