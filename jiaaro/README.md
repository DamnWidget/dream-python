# Dreams

 - One package manager to rule them all
 
 I want to trust pip, but I don't.
 
 - Standardize setup.py (that includes having good documentation)
 
 Really... this is the worst cargo-culting I've seen in the python community. Even the best developers are having to resort to copy/paste to make their setup.py files
