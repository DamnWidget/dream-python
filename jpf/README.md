# Dreams

## Community

- Better introductions to community best practices (For example:
  virtualenv, pep8, nosetests)
- Better ways to learn about *Better Battries Than The Ones That Are
  Included* (For example: flask, requests,  delorean)
  

## Technical

- No more Python 2 / 3 decisions (from @alex).
- The ability to share command line Python applications as "binaries"
  (a la Golang)
- The ability to reference pip libraries in Python source without needing to
  download them first. (For example "import github.com/kennethreitz/requests")
