# Joonas' dream world

For Python, I dream of:

- Being able to use Python 3 everywhere. No more compatibility hacks.
- All libraries having requests-like wonderful Human-usable interface
- Requests as Python built-in; a lot of the time it's my only dependency
- All libraries I use being maintained like Django...
  - predictable deprecation
  - a stable interface
  - a good balance of importing to core project vs. leaving out features for external packages
